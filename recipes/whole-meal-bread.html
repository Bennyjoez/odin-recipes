        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Wholemeal bread is a type of bread made using flour that is partly or entirely milled from whole or almost-whole wheat grains. Baking the bread takes up 30 to 40 minutes at a temperature of 200 to 260°C.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>300 grams white bread flour or all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>200 grams whole-wheat flour or whole-grain spelt flour</li>
            <li>7 grams (1 packet) active dry yeast or instant yeast</li>
            <li>10 grams brown sugar or maple syrup</li>
            <li>10 grams kosher salt</li>
            <li>400 grams (1⅔ cups) warm water</li>
            <li>30 grams mixed seeds such as sunflower, sesame, pumpkin, or flaxseeds (optional)</li>
            <li>10 grams old-fashioned rolled oats (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk the bread flour, whole-wheat flour, yeast, sugar, and salt until combined.</li>
            <li>Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the water.</li>
            <li>Using a wooden spoon, stir the mixture until no dry spots remain and you have a uniform, loose, and slightly sticky dough.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp cloth, and let the dough rise in a warm place until it doubles in size, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Lightly grease a 9-inch loaf pan with vegetable oil or cooking spray and line it with a piece of parchment paper, leaving a bit of overhang on each side to easily transfer the loaf once baked.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Transfer the risen bread dough to a clean, floured surface, and fold the edges of the dough over the center to form a rectangular shape.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough, seam-side down, to the prepared loaf tin.</li>
            <li>In a small mixing bowl, mix the seeds and oats, if using.</li>
            <li>Generously coat the top of the loaf with the seed and oat mixture.</li>
            <li>Let the dough proof in the tin for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>After proofing is complete, bake the loaf until it is golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 140 degrees Fahrenheit, about 50–55 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the loaf from the oven and let it cool for 5 minutes before lifting it out of the tray and transferring it to a wire rack.</li>
            <li>Let the loaf cool to room temperature before slicing, at least 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
